# Key Prompts

Useful prompts from building AltFinder.

---

## Initial Project Setup

> I would like you to make an alternative application I can use instead of Finder that is basically feature complete for all the core things. Like, you need to be able to see the path bar, and you need to be able to, in the list view at least, sort by all options. One of the things I want it to have special is you should be able to pin certain files in a pinned section at top of each folder. plan if needed. else just build.

## Feature Requests

> I want there to be some feature where I can search

> Can you read my Finder favorites?

> Does it stay in sync automatically w finder fav's

---

## Debugging / Troubleshooting

> It's totally blank when I open it. I'm wondering why. Maybe it gets errors or maybe it's not smartly choosing the right free port.

> VM4 sandbox_bundle:2 Unable to load preload script: /Users/jacobcole/code/AltFinder/dist-electron/preload.js

> Sidebar.tsx:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/types/index.ts' does not provide an export named 'SpecialPaths'

> Are you able to see the console output? Or can we somehow send it to you so that you can see it? Can we set it up that way?

---

## Branding / UI Polish

> Also, make sure to give the app an icon and a title, etc.

> I have a bunch of Electron apps running, so even when it's in testing mode, can you get it to have a different name and a different icon maybe?

> The app still doesn't get wider when the window gets wider. I don't think. Can you think about the UI?

> There are multiple applications titled Electron. Should this be the case? And is there a way to change it so that this has a different title even when we're developing?
